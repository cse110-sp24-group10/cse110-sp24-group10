## Discussion Items
- New miro board design
  - Updated design/page layout
- Task Difficulty/Story Points
- Journal includes code editor design?
  - TBD
  - Ask if allowed
  - Should we have edit/add differentiation? How hard to implement?
  - Use? Saving code for later? Jotting down quick snippets? 
- Should popup be summary instead of whole log?
- Coding playground page?
- Should we worry about more features? We are considering our time restrictions.
- Should we start to get a feel first then decide to add features later?
- Popup journal on calendar day considered as future feature instead as core feature
  - Journal should be own page for minimilism/simplicity sake
- Summarizing user stories
  - adding drag and drop feature to task list
  - on checked: strikethrough? transparency change?
  - delete functionality: trashcan? delete button? several click delete?
- Setting page should be a sprint 2 thing -> setup page, but functionality can only be worked on after other pages are done
- functionality across mobile and keyboard support
- how to save/keep stuff after refresh? -> local storage?
- design to put into empty space, determine later
- deciding to remove Codacy from pipeline -> free trial ending/takes time to learn
- using ESLint for linting tool, ADR?
- assigning story points: 
  - calendar, 4
  - task list, 6
  - journal, 5 (without code part)
- where is our sentiment widget going?
- source code architecture ADR

## Decisions Made (lots of decisions already described above as well)
- get html structure and local functionality working at end of first sprint
- design is left to team, basic structure/design should be used as guideline
- Teams:
  - Calendar: Altair, Daris
  - Task List: Anish, Karinna, Mingyang, Pranav
  - Journal: Asher, Jonghun, Michael
  - Anthony absent, so will be determined later, most likely Calendar
- Source code architecture:
  - "root" of our project is in source, test already in there
  - 3 folders, each with their own html/css files and any assets for each page
- ADRS:
  - ESLint ADR: Anish
  - Source code architecture ADR: Altair
  - Jest ADR: Pranav and Michael

## To Do Later
  - Finish functionality
  - Finish design
