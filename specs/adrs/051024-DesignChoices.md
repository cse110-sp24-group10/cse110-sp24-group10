# General Design Choices
[Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKMZsuM0=/)
## Context and Problem Statement

After creating the low fidelity mockups of the developer journal, we wanted to come up with a cohesive theme to 
create branding. When creating the mockups, we noticed how they were bland and wanted to create an overall theme for the 
journal itself. As user's, we recognized how the applying a theme to the application would make the application more 
appealing to use.


<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* A theme is needed as using an application that looked like our fat marker sketches wouldn't be very appealing.
* We liked the minimalism of our design but wanted to apply a theme to add ontop of the current minimalist design.

## Considered Options

* Reference Jake Paul's "Team 10" and their design/branding
* Typewriter-inspired design
* Retro/vintage design

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Retro/vintage design", because mockups already had a vintage feel to them. We initially wanted to do 
something revolving around a typewriter, though it was hard to find many sources of inspriation and applications.

### Consequences

* Good, because the design is pretty unique and add a lot of character and feel to the developer journal
* Good, because the theme gives unified guidelines and decisions to all the team members, which helps get everyone on the
  same page and eliminates confusion.
* Bad, because we have limited our scope, which might limit creativity in terms of design choices, features, aesthetics, etc.
* Bad, because if we ever decide to change our theme, pivoting already created resources can prove to be difficult as the
  theme is unique.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Jake Paul's Team 10

* Good, because the design is already established, resolving problems of confusion and ambiguity.
* Good, because it is a pop culture reference, which people might find relatable and funny.
* Bad, because the novelty might run out.
* Bad, because if user's have a bad perception of Jake Paul, they would be driven away from the app.
* Bad, because it is very limiting in scope, as it would have to revolve around Jake Paul's career.
* Bad, because Jake Paul isn't very related to programming/coding.

### Typewriter

* Good, because the design is already established, resolving problems of confusion and ambiguity.
* Good, because it is unique and since many people know about it, it would be easy to understand and is very cool.
* Bad, because the design is too specific and it was hard to come up with many design choices.
* Bad, because it was hard to apply the theme towards any other element other than a keyboard.

### Retro/Vintage Theme
* Good, because the design has a lot of existing material surrounding it and in many different applications
* Good, because it specifies the scope, which helps everyone stay on the same page and stay on the same creative space.
* Good, because the theme is strong, interesting, and easily recognizable.
* Bad, because it could be limiting in scope and could clash with other design choices and features that don't match the 
theme.
* Bad, because if we ever choose to pivot, some assets might not be transferrable.

## More Information
 The design was chosen at a very early stage of the process. The design is free to change if needs be.
