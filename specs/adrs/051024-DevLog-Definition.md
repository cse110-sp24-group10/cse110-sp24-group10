# Creating a Definition of a Developer Log

## Context and Problem Statement
During the initial brainstorming meeting for our project, all of the team members had varying definitions of what they believed to be a Developer Log or Journal, which prompted the need for a common definition to be decided on for everyone to be on the same page. We came to the conclusion that there are many different ways this concept can be interpreted, and coming up with a common definition would avoid many issues and confusion going forward.

## Decision Drivers

* Some team members felt it would be a better approach to come up with features together and a definition later, while others felt we should come up with a definition first and features derived from that.
* We agreed that organizing workflow would be important going forward to avoid confusion, which included agreeing on a very important part of our project such as this.

## Considered Options

* Ideating out features first, then coming up with a general project idea after
* Coming up with a more general idea of our project first, then brainstorming features after
* Doing both consecutively

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Defining General Project First and Features After", because we felt having an idea of what we were building before specifying features would give everyone explicit clarification on the project.

### Consequences

* Good, because everyone would have a big-picture idea of the project, with everyone being on the same page before thinking of specific features
* Bad, because it might limit scope and create constraints during brainstorming, when some team members felt it might be better to just get all the ideas for features out

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Features First, General Definition Later

* Good, because opens up creativity
* Good, because let's people contribute freely without restriction
* Bad, because different team members could go in different directions, causing confusion
* Bad, because the scope during the brainstorming/ideation phase would be too big causing confusion

### Define the Project First, Features Later

* Good, because team members would be given some sort of structure before brainstorming features
* Good, because there might less confusion when considering features
* Bad, because restrict creativity if the guidelines for the definition of a Developer Journal are too strict
