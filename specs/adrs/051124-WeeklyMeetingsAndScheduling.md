# Deciding weekly meetings 

## Context and Problem Statement

Our group needed to decide on a way to meet up and what scheduling tool to use for our weekly meetings to accommodate everyone's availability efficiently and minimize scheduling conflicts. We want a solution that promotes productivity and flexibility without imposing repercussions for missing meetings. This would allow team members to work on what they want at their pace while still meeting the deadlines our group has set.

## Decision Drivers

* Needed efficient scheduling without conflicts
* We want to promote productivity and flexibility of team members working on the project
* Maximize workflow and communication in large groups, smaller groups, or individual work
* Minimal repercussions for missing meetings, as long as team members work on the project and update on Slack

## Considered Options

* Using Slack to notify availibility 
* When2Meet or LettuceMeet that would allow group members to choose their availibility for the whole week.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "When2Meet or LettuceMeet that would allow group members to choose their availibility for the whole week", because it offers a user-friendly interface and robust scheduling capabilities that align with our group's needs for efficient and flexible meeting scheduling. If there are smaller groups within the team that want to meet they can coordinate with their own When2meet/LettuceMeet.

### Consequences

* Good, because When2Meet/LettuceMeet provides an intuitive interface and allows for easy coordination of availability.
* Good, because it promotes productivity and flexibility by enabling members to indicate their preferred meeting times without penalties for missed meetings.
* Good, allows smaller teams within the group to schedule meet ups.
* Bad, doesn't specify the meet up type like in-person, over Zoom, or hybrid.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Using Slack to notify availibility
* Good, because it offers instant communication and is convenient as everyone already has a Slack account.
* Neutral, because has limited scheduling features.
* Bad, because lack of formality which may cause some messages regarding scheduling to be overlooked.
* Bad, because team members might not check the channel and not be notified by sudden changes.

### When2Meet or LettuceMeet

* Good, because it offers a user-friendly interface for scheduling.
* Good, because it allows for flexible coordination of availability.
* Good, because it provides scheduling capabilities.
* Neutral, because members don't need an account to set scheduling.
* Neutral, able to send it out quickly on Slack.
* Bad, because it may require additional effort to ensure everyone's participation.


## More Information

We will continue to monitor the implementation of When2Meet/LettuceMeet and gather feedback from group members to ensure it continues to meet our scheduling and productivity needs effectively.
