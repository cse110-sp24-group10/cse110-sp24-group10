# General Design Choices
## Context and Problem Statement

After coming up with specific features and ideas, as well as our group's definition of what a coding journal could be, we needed a layout to contain all of the features. We noticed that having a proper UI would be important in establishing our product's identity of being a coding journal.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* Having a barebones website without a proper user interface would make the product as a whole ineffective
* UI layout is important to establish to outline the features to include and what needs to be removed/added

## Considered Options

* Prioritizing the journal entry as the front facing part of the product
* Focusing on having a team-based ease of access log that would completely separate each feature into separate pages
* Having a calendar as the introductory screen, with an overlay of the entry, and all other features stemming from the two

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Having a calendar as the introductory screen, with an overlay of the entry, and all other features stemming from the two". This was the chosen decision, as we found that the layout was easier to navigate and understand as a first-time user if the calendar was the main focus. Additionally, having an overlay for the journal entry kept a sense of flow for our ideas and meshed with most features.

### Consequences

* Good, as the layout is very easy to understand
* Good, as the calendar gives a sense of structure for the logs that is easy to access
* Bad, since adding elements like overlays lead to higher complexity, which can run into issues with connecting features
* Bad, as it may be too generalized, and lose its identity of being a coding journal

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Prioritizing Journal Entry

* Good, since it focuses most directly on the coding journal
* Good, will be easy to submit entries for the journal
* Bad, does not maintain a sense of flow for the journal without complicating UI
* Bad, does not mesh as well with other features

### Separate Pages for Each Feature

* Good, creates a clear layout which makes it easy for users to independently use each feature
* Good, maintains minimalism in its structure, allowing for simplicity for coding and understanding
* Bad, limits scope and potential of each feature by confining it to one page each
* Bad, incredibly hard to create a cohesive set of features to work in tandem

## More Information
 The UI layout was chosen at a very early stage of the process, with some flexibility kept in mind. The design is free to change to accomodate for new or changing features.
