### Problem
----
No centralized tool for:
- Calendar
- ***Daily Journal***
- Task List

Especially nothing tailored for a *developer*

### Solution
---
**Who are we:**

We are a group of students wishing to tackle the issue of lack of chronicling for developers. 

The reason why we feel it is important to tackle this problem is because chronicling can be an immensely useful tool when trying to prove one’s contribution to their company

**Our Approach:**

We decided to tackle this issue by breaking down our requirements into three areas: need, should and could.

We have done this to ensure that if we are only able to progress our project till a certain point, the functionalities existing should be more than enough in helping developers record their progress.

### Statement of Purpose
---
**Our Group:**

As a group of students, we wanted to make a developer log for all kinds of coders. We thought about features that students, employees, and managers alike could find useful. Our group’s vision is to create an accessible and easy to use log for a programmer of any level.

**Our Idea:**

Our end goal is to create a tool that houses the documentation process of coding all in one place. From calendars, journal entries, task lists, and more, we hope to organize our user’s coding itinerary more easily and efficiently.

### User Personas
---
As a *project manager* of a development team I would like to see what tasks each member has worked on throughout the day.

As a *developer* who is part of a *working team* I would like to keep track of my own work to present at future raise negotiations

As an *independent freelance programmer* I would like to have documentation for the process and work that I myself have done.

### Risks and Rabbit Holes
---
**Scope:**
- Our target audience is large, so it may be hard trying to make the features usable for many different types of programmers
- We have a lot of features planned, and we may be too ambitious with them
- Features tailored for specific groups of programmers may not mesh with others and cause confusion, limiting ease of use

**Team Experience:**
- Our team is relatively new to overall web development, so there is a lack of exposure/knowledge behind what it takes for some of the implementations
- Our team’s schedule does not allow for all of us to meet consistently/all at the same time, so we are worried about time management issues
- Our team has not yet decided how to assign work/who gets to work on what
- Our strengths and weaknesses as individuals are unclear due to being grouped recently

**Design:**
- Since we have many features we want to implement, our design may be changed frequently
- Design might have accessibility issues due to complexity

**Repo Management:**
- We struggled with the git process in general for the warm up, so we are worried about the process again
- We are worried about merge conflicts during team processes
